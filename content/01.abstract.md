## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated significant interest due to their potential for accessibility and automation in various fields, including biomedicine.
However, they also present challenges and risks of misuse.
In this paper, we address the need for a framework to interface with LLMs in the biomedical domain while ensuring their safe and effective use.
To meet this need, we introduce BioChatter, an open-source framework that integrates various functionalities of LLMs, such as knowledge integration, retrieval-augmented generation, model chaining, and benchmarking.
By leveraging open-source software packages, we have developed a user-friendly and versatile platform that can be applied across a range of biomedicine use cases.
Our focus is on implementing robust and privacy-preserving local open-source LLMs.
We showcase the utility of BioChatter through two multi-purpose web apps available at [https://chat.biocypher.org](https://chat.biocypher.org) and provide comprehensive documentation, support, and a vibrant open community.
