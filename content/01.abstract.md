## Abstract

The recent surge in the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked immense interest due to their potential for enhancing accessibility and automation in various fields, including biomedicine.
However, this advancement also brings forth significant challenges, including the risk of misuse and the need for effective interfacing mechanisms.
To address these issues, particularly in the biomedical domain, we introduce BioChatter, a dedicated, open-source framework designed to facilitate the integration of LLMs while ensuring their use is constrained in a sensible manner.
BioChatter leverages existing open-source software packages to combine several emerging functionalities related to LLMs, such as knowledge integration through retrieval-augmented generation, model chaining, and benchmarking.
Our framework offers an accessible, user-friendly platform tailored for a wide range of biomedical applications.
Emphasizing robustness and ease of use, BioChatter includes features for deploying privacy-preserving, local open-source LLMs.
We showcase the framework's versatility through two multi-purpose web applications (available at [https://chat.biocypher.org](https://chat.biocypher.org)), and support our users with comprehensive documentation, ongoing support, and a collaborative community.
